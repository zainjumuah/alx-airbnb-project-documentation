# **Airbnb Clone Backend — Key Features and Functionalities**

## **Objective**

To identify and document the core features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend based on the provided project requirements.
The backend must provide robust, scalable, and secure services that enable user management, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, notifications, and administrative control.

---

## **1. User Management**

### **1.1 User Registration**

* Users can register as either **guests** or **hosts**.
* Registration requires basic information such as name, email, password, and role.
* Passwords are securely stored using hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
* Each user is assigned a **UUID** for unique identification.
* Email uniqueness is enforced to prevent duplicate accounts.

### **1.2 Authentication & Authorization**

* Implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management.
* Supports **OAuth login** through providers like **Google** and **Facebook**.
* Includes **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

  * Guests can browse, book, and review.
  * Hosts can manage properties and respond to reviews.
  * Admins can monitor and manage users, bookings, and payments.

### **1.3 Profile Management**

* Users can update:

  * Profile photo, contact info, and bio.
  * Preferences such as language and notification settings.
* Hosts can manage personal and hosting-related details from their profile.

---

## **2. Property Listings Management**

### **2.1 Add Listings**

* Hosts can create property listings with:

  * Title, description, location, price per night, capacity, and amenities.
* Property images are uploaded and stored in **file storage** (e.g., AWS S3 or local storage).

### **2.2 Edit/Delete Listings**

* Hosts can update or delete existing property listings.
* All updates automatically modify the `updated_at` timestamp.

### **2.3 Availability and Pricing**

* Each listing includes:

  * Nightly price (decimal).
  * Availability dates.
  * Maximum guest capacity.

---

## **3. Search and Filtering**

* Guests can search for properties by:

  * Location.
  * Price range.
  * Number of guests.
  * Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, parking).
* Supports pagination for large datasets.
* Search queries can be optimized using **Redis caching** for performance.

---

## **4. Booking Management**

### **4.1 Booking Creation**

* Guests can book available properties for specific start and end dates.
* System prevents **double bookings** using date validation.
* Each booking record includes total price and current status.

### **4.2 Booking Status and Lifecycle**

* Booking statuses:

  * **Pending:** Created but awaiting confirmation/payment.
  * **Confirmed:** Payment completed and dates reserved.
  * **Canceled:** Booking canceled by guest or host.
  * **Completed:** Stay has concluded successfully.

### **4.3 Booking Cancellation**

* Both hosts and guests can cancel bookings based on defined policies.
* Refund or penalty logic is handled in the payment workflow.

---

## **5. Payment Integration**

### **5.1 Payment Processing**

* Integrated with **Stripe** and **PayPal** for secure transactions.
* Guests make upfront payments upon booking confirmation.
* Hosts automatically receive payouts after booking completion.

### **5.2 Multi-Currency Support**

* Payment processing supports multiple currencies.
* Currency conversion handled at the gateway level.

### **5.3 Payment Records**

* Each payment is linked to one booking.
* Payment attributes include:

  * Amount.
  * Date.
  * Payment method (credit card, PayPal, or Stripe).
  * Status (pending, completed, failed).

---

## **6. Reviews and Ratings**

### **6.1 Guest Reviews**

* Guests can leave a **rating (1–5)** and text review after completing a stay.
* Reviews are tied directly to **bookings** to prevent fraudulent feedback.

### **6.2 Host Responses**

* Hosts can respond to guest reviews through their dashboard.
* Both reviews and responses are timestamped.

### **6.3 Review Moderation**

* Admins can flag or remove inappropriate reviews.

---

## **7. Notifications System**

### **7.1 Email and In-App Notifications**

* Triggered events include:

  * Booking confirmations and cancellations.
  * Payment updates.
  * Review notifications.
* Emails sent via **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** API.
* In-app notifications stored in a separate notifications table.

---

## **8. Admin Dashboard**

### **8.1 Administrative Oversight**

* Admins can view and manage:

  * User accounts.
  * Property listings.
  * Bookings and payments.
  * Reported reviews and disputes.

### **8.2 Security and Monitoring**

* Admin dashboard provides:

  * Real-time data overview (bookings, payments, users).
  * Logging and analytics for audits.

---

## **9. Technical and System Features**

### **9.1 API Design**

* RESTful API endpoints implementing:

  * **GET** for retrieving resources.
  * **POST** for creating resources.
  * **PUT/PATCH** for updating resources.
  * **DELETE** for removing resources.
* GraphQL is optional for complex data retrieval.

### **9.2 Authentication Middleware**

* Middleware verifies JWT tokens for protected routes.
* Enforces role-based access rules.

### **9.3 File Storage**

* Profile and property images are stored securely.
* Supports local file storage during development and AWS S3 for production.

### **9.4 Error Handling and Logging**

* Global error handler for all API routes.
* Centralized logs for debugging (e.g., via Winston or Morgan).

### **9.5 Testing and Quality Assurance**

* Unit and integration tests using **Pytest** or equivalent.
* API tests for endpoint validation and consistency.
