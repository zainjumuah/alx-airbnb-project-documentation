# **Backend Requirement Specifications — Airbnb Clone Project**

---

## **Objective**

To define the **technical and functional specifications** for the core backend features of the Airbnb Clone application.
This document outlines API structure, input/output parameters, validation rules, and performance requirements for each selected feature.

## **1. User Authentication System**

### **1.1 Overview**

The **User Authentication** feature enables users (guests, hosts, and admins) to securely register, log in, and maintain authenticated sessions.
It ensures role-based access control (RBAC) and secure session management using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

---

### **1.2 Functional Requirements**

| ID      | Requirement Description                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTH-01 | The system shall allow users to register using their first name, last name, email, password, and role (guest/host/admin). |
| AUTH-02 | The system shall hash passwords using a secure algorithm (bcrypt or Argon2).                                              |
| AUTH-03 | The system shall generate JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.                                                          |
| AUTH-04 | The system shall validate tokens for all protected routes.                                                                |
| AUTH-05 | The system shall support OAuth login (e.g., Google, Facebook) as an alternative authentication method.                    |
| AUTH-06 | The system shall enforce email uniqueness and input validation.                                                           |
